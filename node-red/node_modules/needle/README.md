Needle
======

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/needle.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/needle/)

The leanest and most handsome HTTP client in the Nodelands.

```js
var needle = require('needle');

needle.get('http://www.google.com', function(error, response) {
  if (!error && response.statusCode == 200)
    console.log(response.body);
});
```

Callbacks not floating your boat? Needle got your back.

```js
var data = {
  file: '/home/johnlennon/walrus.png',
  content_type: 'image/png'
};

needle
  .post('https://my.server.com/foo', data, { multipart: true })
  .on('readable', function() { /* eat your chunks */ })
  .on('done', function() {
    console.log('Ready-o, friend-o.');
  })
```

With only one real dependency, Needle supports:

 - HTTP/HTTPS requests, with the usual verbs you would expect
 - All of Node's native TLS options, such as 'rejectUnauthorized' (see below)
 - Basic & Digest authentication
 - Multipart form-data (e.g. file uploads)
 - HTTP Proxy forwarding, optionally with authentication
 - Streaming gzip or deflate decompression
 - Automatic XML & JSON parsing
 - 301/302/303 redirect following, with fine-grained tuning, and
 - Streaming non-UTF-8 charset decoding, via `iconv-lite`

And yes, Mr. Wayne, it does come with streams2 support.

This makes Needle an ideal alternative for performing quick HTTP requests in Node, either for API interaction, downloading or uploading streams of data, and so on. If you need OAuth, AWS support or anything fancier, you should check out mikeal's request module.

Install
-------

```
$ npm install needle
```

Usage
-----

```js
// using callback
needle.get('ifconfig.me/all.json', function(error, response, body) {
  if (!error) {
    // body is an alias for `response.body`
    console.log(body.ip_addr); // that in this case holds a JSON-decoded object.
  }
});

// using streams
var out = fs.createWriteStream('logo.png');
needle.get('https://google.com/images/logo.png').pipe(out).on('finish', function() {
  console.log('Pipe finished!');
});
```

As you can see, you can call Needle with a callback or without it. When passed, the response body will be buffered and written to `response.body`, and the callback will be fired when all of the data has been collected and processed (e.g. decompressed, decoded and/or parsed).

When no callback is passed, the buffering logic will be skipped but the response stream will still go through Needle's processing pipeline, so you get all the benefits of post-processing while keeping the streamishness we all love from Node.

Response pipeline
-----------------

Depending on the response's Content-Type, Needle will either attempt to parse JSON or XML streams, or, if a text response was received, will ensure that the final encoding you get is UTF-8. For XML decoding to work, though, you'll need to install the `xml2js` package as we don't enforce unneeded dependencies unless strictly needed.

You can also request a gzip/deflated response, which, if sent by the server, will be processed before parsing or decoding is performed.

```js
needle.get('http://stackoverflow.com/feeds', { compressed: true }, function(err, resp) {
  console.log(resp.body); // this little guy won't be a Gzipped binary blob
                          // but a nice object containing all the latest entries
});
```

Or in anti-callback mode, using a few other options:

```js
var options = {
  compressed         : true, // sets 'Accept-Encoding' to 'gzip,deflate'
  follow_max         : 5,    // follow up to five redirects
  rejectUnauthorized : true  // verify SSL certificate
}

var stream = needle.get('https://backend.server.com/everything.html', options);

// read the chunks from the 'readable' event, so the stream gets consumed.
stream.on('readable', function() {
  while (data = this.read()) {
    console.log(data.toString());
  }
})

stream.on('done', function(err) {
  // if our request had an error, our 'done' event will tell us.
  if (!err) console.log('Great success!');
})
```

API
---

All of Needle's request methods return a Readable stream, and both `options` and `callback` are optional. If passed, the callback will return three arguments: `error`, `response` and `body`, which is basically an alias for `response.body`.

### needle.head(url[, options][, callback])

```js
var options = {
  open_timeout: 5000 // if we don't get our response headers in 5 seconds, boom.
}

needle.head('https://my.backend.server.com', function(err, resp) {
  if (err)
    console.log('Shoot! Something is wrong: ' + err.message)
  else
    console.log('Yup, still alive.')
})
```

### needle.get(url[, options][, callback])

```js
needle.get('google.com/search?q=syd+barrett', function(err, resp) {
  // if no http:// is found, Needle will automagically prepend it.
});
```

### needle.post(url, data[, options][, callback])

```js
var options = {
  headers: { 'X-Custom-Header': 'Bumbaway atuna' }
}

needle.post('https://my.app.com/endpoint', 'foo=bar', options, function(err, resp) {
  // you can pass params as a string or as an object.
});
```

### needle.put(url, data[, options][, callback])

```js
var nested = {
  params: {
    are: {
      also: 'supported'
    }
  }
}

needle.put('https://api.app.com/v2', nested, function(err, resp) {
  console.log('Got ' + resp.bytes + ' bytes.') // another nice treat from this handsome fella.
});
```

### needle.patch(url, data[, options][, callback])

Same behaviour as PUT.

### needle.delete(url, data[, options][, callback])

```js
var options = {
  username: 'fidelio',
  password: 'x'
}

needle.delete('https://api.app.com/messages/123', null, options, function(err, resp) {
  // in this case, data may be null, but you need to explicity pass it.
});
```

### needle.request(method, url, data[, options][, callback])

Generic request. This not only allows for flexibility, but also lets you perform a GET request with data, in which case will be appended to the request as a query string, unless you pass a `json: true` option (read below).

```js
var params = {
  q    : 'a very smart query',
  page : 2
}

needle.request('get', 'forum.com/search', params, function(err, resp) {
  if (!err && resp.statusCode == 200)
    console.log(resp.body); // here you go, mister.
});
```

Now, if you set pass `json: true` among the options, Needle won't set your params as a querystring but instead send a JSON representation of your data through the request's body, as well as set the `Content-Type` and `Accept` headers to `application/json`.

```js
needle.request('get', 'forum.com/search', params, { json: true }, function(err, resp) {
  if (resp.statusCode == 200) console.log('It worked!');
});
```

Events
------

All of the above methods return a [Readable stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable) that emits the following events, in addition to the regular ones (e.g. `end`, `close`, `data`, `pipe`, `readable`).

### Event: `'response'`

 - `response <http.IncomingMessage>`

Emitted when the underlying [http.ClientRequest](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_clientrequest) emits a response event. This is after the connection is established and the header received, but before any of it is processed (e.g. authorization required or redirect to be followed). No data has been consumed at this point.

### Event: `'redirect'`

 - `location <String>`

Indicates that the a redirect is being followed. This means that the response code was a redirect (`301`, `302`, `303`, `307`) and the given [redirect options](#redirect-options) allowed following the URL received in the `Location` header.

### Event: `'header'`

 - `statusCode <Integer>`
 - `headers <Object>`

Triggered after the header has been processed, and just before the data is to be consumed. This implies that no redirect was followed and/or authentication header was received. In other words, we got a "valid" response.

### Event: `'done'`

 - `exception <Error>` (optional)

Emitted when the request/response process has finished, either because all data was consumed or an error ocurred somewhere in between. Unlike a regular stream's `end` event, Needle's `done` will be fired either on success or on failure, which is why the first argument may be an Error object. In other words:

```js
var resp = needle.get('something.worthy/of/being/streamed/by/needle')
                 .pipe(somewhereElse);

resp.on('done', function(err) {
  if (err) console.log('An error ocurred: ' + err.message);
  else console.log('Great success!');
})
```

### Event: `'err'`

 - `exception <Error>`

Emitted when an error ocurrs. This should only happen once in the lifecycle of a Needle request.

### Event: `'timeout'`

 - `type <String>`

Emitted when an timeout error occurs. Type can be either 'open' or 'read'. This will called right before aborting the request, which will also trigger an `err` event, a described above, with an `ECONNRESET` (Socket hang up) exception.

Request options
---------------

For information about options that've changed, there's always [the changelog](https://github.com/tomas/needle/releases).

 - `agent`       : Uses an [http.Agent](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent) of your choice, instead of the global, default one. Useful for tweaking the behaviour at the connection level, such as when doing tunneling (see below for an example).
 - `json`        : When `true`, sets content type to `application/json` and sends request body as JSON string, instead of a query string.
 - `open_timeout`: (or `timeout`) Returns error if connection takes longer than X milisecs to establish. Defaults to `10000` (10 secs). `0` means no timeout.
 - `read_timeout`: Returns error if data transfer takes longer than X milisecs, after connection is established. Defaults to `0` (no timeout).
 - `follow_max`  : (or `follow`) Number of redirects to follow. Defaults to `0`. See below for more redirect options.
 - `multipart`   : Enables multipart/form-data encoding. Defaults to `false`. Use it when uploading files.
 - `proxy`       : Forwards request through HTTP(s) proxy. Eg. `proxy: 'http://user:pass@proxy.server.com:3128'`. For more advanced proxying/tunneling use a custom `agent`, as described below.
 - `headers`     : Object containing custom HTTP headers for request. Overrides defaults described below.
 - `auth`        : Determines what to do with provided username/password. Options are `auto`, `digest` or `basic` (default). `auto` will detect the type of authentication depending on the response headers.
 - `stream_length`: When sending streams, this lets you manually set the Content-Length header --if the stream's bytecount is known beforehand--, preventing ECONNRESET (socket hang up) errors on some servers that misbehave when receiving payloads of unknown size. Set it to `0` and Needle will get and set the stream's length for you, or leave unset for the default behaviour, which is no Content-Length header for stream payloads.

Response options
----------------

 - `decode_response` : (or `decode`) Whether to decode the text responses to UTF-8, if Content-Type header shows a different charset. Defaults to `true`.
 - `parse_response`  : (or `parse`) Whether to parse XML or JSON response bodies automagically. Defaults to `true`. You can also set this to 'xml' or 'json' in which case Needle will *only* parse the response if the content type matches.
 - `output`          : Dump response output to file. This occurs after parsing and charset decoding is done.
 - `parse_cookies`   : Whether to parse response’s `Set-Cookie` header. Defaults to `true`. If parsed, response cookies will be available at `resp.cookies`.

Note: To stay light on dependencies, Needle doesn't include the `xml2js` module used for XML parsing. To enable it, simply do `npm install xml2js`.

HTTP Header options
-------------------

These are basically shortcuts to the `headers` option described above.

 - `cookies`   : Builds and sets a Cookie header from a `{ key: 'value' }` object.
 - `compressed`: If `true`, sets 'Accept-Encoding' header to 'gzip,deflate', and inflates content if zipped. Defaults to `false`.
 - `username`  : For HTTP basic auth.
 - `password`  : For HTTP basic auth. Requires username to be passed, but is optional.
 - `accept`    : Sets 'Accept' HTTP header. Defaults to `*/*`.
 - `connection`: Sets 'Connection' HTTP header. Not set by default, unless running Node < 0.11.4 in which case it defaults to `close`. More info about this below.
 - `user
