## How to Use ##

The node provides two methods for providing the SQL code for the query:
<br />
- <i>fixed</i> - convenient for permanent SQL statements. The SQL is entered directly in the node configurator.
<br />
- <i>msg.topic</i> - for dynamic statements. The SQL is composed via a functions node and appended to the message's topic attribute before sent onwards.


Using any SQL query, the result is returned in <code>msg.payload</code>.
After submitting the query a response message in the payload will be
returned in the following format:
<br />
- Success response<br />
<code>{"status":"success","message":"Message text","data":[]}</code>
- Success response<br />
<code>{"status":"error","message":"Message text"}</code>
<br />
Checking the "status" attribute allows to find out if the SQL query
was executed successfully.
<br />
Checking the "message" attribute allows to find out more information about the query's result.
<br />
The "data" attribute contains the records returned by SELECT type queries.
