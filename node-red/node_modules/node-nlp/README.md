*If you're looking for the version 3 docs, you can find them here* [Version 3](https://github.com/axa-group/nlp.js/blob/master/docs/v3/README.md)

"NLP.js" is a general natural language utility for nodejs. Currently supporting:

- Guess the language of a phrase
- Fast levenshtein distance of two strings
- Search the best substring of a string with less levenshtein distance to a given pattern.
- Get stemmers and tokenizers for several languages.
- Sentiment Analysis for phrases (with negation support).
- Named Entity Recognition and management, multilanguage, and accepting similar strings, so the introduced text does not need to be exact.
- Natural Language Processing Classifier, to classify utterance into intents.
- Natural Language Generation Manager, so from intents and conditions it can generate an answer.
- NLP Manager: a tool able to manage several languages, the Named Entities for each language, the utterance, and intents for the training of the classifier, and for a given utterance return the entity extraction, the intent classification and the sentiment analysis. Also, it is able to maintain a Natural Language Generation Manager for the answers.
- 40 languages natively supported, 104 languages supported with BERT integration
- Any other language is supported through tokenization, even fantasy languages

## New in version 4`!`

The version 4 is very different from previous versions. Until this version, NLP.js was a monolithic library. The big changes:

- Now is splitted into small independant packages.
- So every language has its own package
- It provides a plugin system, so you can provide your own plugins or replace the existing ones.
- It provides a container system for the plugins, settings of the plugins and also pipelines
- A pipeline is code of how the plugins interact. Usually is something linear: there is an input into the plugin, and generates the input for the next one. To put an example about this, now the preparation of a utterance (the process to convert the utterance to a hashmap of stemmed features) is a pipeline like this: normalize -> tokenize -> removeStopwords -> stem -> arrToObj
- There is simple compiler for the pipelines, but can be also build using a modified version of javascript and python (compilers are also included as plugins, so other languages can be added as a plugin).
- Now NLP.js includes also connectors, understanding connector as something that has at least 2 methods: hear and say. Example of connectors included: Console Connector, Microsoft Bot Framework Connector and a Direct Line Offline Connector (this one allows to build a web chatbot using the Microsoft Webchat, but without having to deploy anything in Azure).
- Some plugins can be registered by language so for different languages different plugins will be used. Also some plugins, like NLU, can be registered not only by language but also by domain (functional set of intents that can be trained separately)
- One example of the previous things is that as a Microsoft LUIS NLU plugin is provided, you can make that your chatbots use the NLU of NLP.js for some languages/domains, and LUIS for other languages/domains.
- Having plugins and pipelines makes it possible to write chatbots only modifying the configuration and the pipelines file, without modifying the code.

## Installation

If you're looking to use NLP.js in your node application, you can install via NPM like so:

```bash
    npm install node-nlp
```

## React Native

There is a version of NLP.js that works in React Native, so you can build chatbots that can be trained and executed on the mobile even without internet. You can install it via NPM:

```bash
    npm install node-nlp-rn
```

Some Limitations:

- No Chinese
- Japanese stemmer is not the complete one
- No excel import
- No loading from a file neither save to a file, but it still has import form json and export to json.

## Example of use

You can see a great example of use at the folder [`/examples/02-qna-classic`](https://github.com/axa-group/nlp.js/tree/master/examples/02-qna-classic). This example is able to train the bot and save the model to a file, so when the bot is started again, the model is loaded instead of trained again.

You can start to build your NLP from scratch with few lines:

```javascript
const { NlpManager } = require('node-nlp');

const manager = new NlpManager({ languages: ['en'], forceNER: true });
// Adds the utterances and intents for the NLP
manager.addDocument('en', 'goodbye for now', 'greetings.bye');
manager.addDocument('en', 'bye bye take care', 'greetings.bye');
manager.addDocument('en', 'okay see you later', 'greetings.bye');
manager.addDocument('en', 'bye for now', 'greetings.bye');
manager.addDocument('en', 'i must go', 'greetings.bye');
manager.addDocument('en', 'hello', 'greetings.hello');
manager.addDocument('en', 'hi', 'greetings.hello');
manager.addDocument('en', 'howdy', 'greetings.hello');

// Train also the NLG
manager.addAnswer('en', 'greetings.bye', 'Till next time');
manager.addAnswer('en', 'greetings.bye', 'see you soon!');
manager.addAnswer('en', 'greetings.hello', 'Hey there!');
manager.addAnswer('en', 'greetings.hello', 'Greetings!');

// Train and save the model.
(async() => {
    await manager.train();
    manager.save();
    const response = await manager.process('en', 'I should go now');
    console.log(response);
})();
```

This will show this result in console:

```bash
{ utterance: 'I should go now',
  locale: 'en',
  languageGuessed: false,
  localeIso2: 'en',
  language: 'English',
  domain: 'default',
  classifications:
   [ { label: 'greetings.bye', value: 0.698219120207268 },
     { label: 'None', value: 0.30178087979273216 },
     { label: 'greetings.hello', value: 0 } ],
  intent: 'greetings.bye',
  score: 0.698219120207268,
  entities:
   [ { start: 12,
       end: 14,
       len: 3,
       accuracy: 0.95,
       sourceText: 'now',
       utteranceText: 'now',
       entity: 'datetime',
       resolution: [Object] } ],
  sentiment:
   { score: 1,
     comparative: 0.25,
     vote: 'positive',
     numWords: 4,
     numHits: 2,
     type: 'senticon',
     language: 'en' },
  actions: [],
  srcAnswer: 'Till next time',
  answer: 'Till next time' }
```

## False Positives

By default, the neural network tries to avoid false positives. To achieve that, one of the internal processes is that words never seen by the network, are represented as a feature that gives some weight into the None intent. So if you try the previous example with "I have to go" it will return the None intent because 2 of the 4 words have been never seen while training.
If you don't want to avoid those false positives, and you feel more comfortable with classifications into the intents that you declare, then you can disable this behavior with the useNoneFeature setting to false:

```javascript
const manager = new NlpManager({ languages: ['en'], nlu: { useNoneFeature: false } });
```

## Log Training Progress

You can also add a log progress, so you can trace what is happening during the training.
You can log the progress into console:

```javascript
const nlpManager = new NlpManager({ languages: ['en'], nlu: { log: true } });
```

Or you can provide your own log function:

```javascript
const logfn = (status, time) => console.log(status, time);
const nlpManager = new NlpManager({ languages: ['en'], nlu: { log: logfn } });
```
